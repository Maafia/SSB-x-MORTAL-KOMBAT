# Instructions / How to Patch

Take your Super Smash Bros. (U) [!] Rom, click and drag it over the "windows-drag-here.bat" file,
and it should patch all the rom for you, they will sit in the folder called "Output". 
Note: If the rom doesnt work with the bat file, 
you might own the wrong Smash 64 rom, please check to make sure its  (U) [!]
